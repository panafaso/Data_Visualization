# Data_Visualization
This project presents an interactive Tableau Public dashboard analyzing road traffic accidents in Greece during 2022, using official data from ELSTAT (Hellenic Statistical Authority). The Visualization has been conducted in the context of the university module: M126-Data Visualization, in the Department of Informatics and Telecommunication at NKUA. You can find my visualization entering my Tableau Public website: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/panagiotis.fasoulidis/viz/Book3_17434524678390/Dashboard-RoadAccidentsinGreece
